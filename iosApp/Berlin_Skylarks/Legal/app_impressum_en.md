**Content warning**.

The freely accessible content of this app was created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider of this app does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the provided freely accessible game and team data, journalistic guides and news. Contributions identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. Simply by reading the freely accessible content, no contractual relationship whatsoever is established between the user and the provider; in this respect, there is no intention on the part of the provider to be legally bound.

**Liability for contents**

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content in this app in accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG under the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringement, we will remove the content in question immediately.

**Liability for links**

Our app contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the sites is always responsible for the content of the linked sites. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

**Copyright**

The content and works created by the app operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.
