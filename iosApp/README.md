# Berlin Skylarks
iOS/macOS App for the Berlin Skylarks Baseball &amp; Softball Club, built in Swift.

Intended Features:

* Display team scores via BSM API
* Display news from https://www.tib-baseball.de
* Display player profiles from https://www.tib-baseball.de
* Display standings via BSM API
* Home dashboard to display all information on your favorite team at a glance

Play Ball! ⚾️🥎

Note: The app requires a BSM API key to function which is not shipped in the public code (documentation: https://bsm.baseball-softball.de/api_docs). Please get in touch for information on how to acquire one (although I would assume that if you are interested in German baseball/softball, you would know where to get one).

Contact info: app@tib-baseball.de

## API Integration

- **BSM API**: Used for live scores and standings.
- **TIB Website**: Used for news and player profiles.
- All network requests are handled asynchronously using Swift's `URLSession`.

## Development History

> [!NOTE]
> This projects started as a learning project as a complete beginner - older parts of the code might not reach current standards of code quality. Refactoring is happening according to the campfire principle.

## Roadmap

- Mostly feature complete and not under active development at the moment, maintenance releases for new iOS versions.
