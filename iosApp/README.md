# Berlin Skylarks
iOS/macOS/watchOS App for the Berlin Skylarks Baseball &amp; Softball Club, built in Swift.

Intended Features:

* Display team scores via BSM API

* Display news from https://www.tib-baseball.de

* Display player profiles from https://www.tib-baseball.de

* Display standings via BSM API

* Home dashboard to display all information on your favorite team at a glance

Play Ball! ‚öæÔ∏èü•é

Note: The app requires a BSM API key to function which is not shipped in the public code (documentation: https://bsm.baseball-softball.de/api_docs). Please get in touch for information on how to acquire one (although I would assume that if you are interested in German baseball/softball, you would know where to get one).

## Development History

- Started as a learning project into Programming in general as a complete beginner - therefore very different standards of code quality present.

## Roadmap

- Mostly feature complete and not under active development at the moment, maintenance releases for new iOS versions.
