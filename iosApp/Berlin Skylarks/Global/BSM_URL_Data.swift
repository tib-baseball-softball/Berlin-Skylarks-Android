//logos for easy usage

//-----------------------------change league IDs here--------------------------------//

//those IDs are not the LEAGUE IDs in BSM, they are the LEAGUEGROUP IDs (slightly different)
//MARK: WIP to make the whole process dynamic

//-------------------------------SCORES------------------------------------//

//BSM API URLS to get the games //////
//those are hardcoded to the year 2021 - so I would need to push an update at least once a year, but there might also be a solution that works continually

//force unwrapping should not be an issue here - these are never nil

//URLs used on BSM web frontend - now loaded locally in ScoresView

//let urlPreviousGameday = URL(string: "https://bsm.baseball-softball.de/clubs/" + skylarksID + "/matches.json?filter[seasons][]=" + currentSeason + "&search=skylarks&filters[gamedays][]=previous&api_key=" + apiKey)!

//-------------------------------STANDINGS/TABLES---------------------------------//

//these need to be changed every year after the schedule is published - there is no option to collect all tables for Skylarks teams like I do with scores (WIP to find one)
//apparently they also do not need an API key (?)

//URLs now loaded locally

//let leagueTableURLs = [ team1.leagueTableURL,
//                        teamSoftball.leagueTableURL,

//                        team3.leagueTableURL,
